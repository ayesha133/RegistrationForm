# RegistrationForm

A short and simple registration form made with a javascript Html & CSS frontend and a PHP backend with a mySQL database. The jQuery Ajax POST method was implemented in the backend to allow the submitted information to be sent to the mySQL database without refreshing the user's page after clicking submit.

After the user clicked submit, the information is also sent to the owner's email.
